                        Parrots are vocal learners: we can learn to <br> make new sounds after we’ve heard them. It’s an <br> ability that few animals possess. A dog may <br>understand dozens of commands, but it will never do anything but bark.
                        <br class="breakStyle2">
                        Humans are vocal learners, too. We have that <br> in common. So humans and parrots share a special relationship with sound. We don’t simply cry out. We pronounce. We enunciate.

                    Perhaps that’s why humans built Arecibo the way they did. <br> A receiver doesn’t have to be a transmitter, but Arecibo is both. It’s an ear for listening, and a mouth for speaking.

                        I suppose I can’t blame them. We parrots <br> used to think humans weren’t very bright. <br> It’s hard to make sense of behavior that’s <br> so different from your own.

                    When we speak, we use the breath in our <br> lungs to give our thoughts a physical form. <br>The sounds we make are simultaneously our intentions and our life force.
